# HabitBloom
This app helps you track your daily habits and routines. It’s easy to use and lets you set goals and check your progress. You can also write notes and create digital post-it notes to remind yourself about your habits or add motivational messages.

You can see how you're doing with progress charts and view your habits on a calendar or by the week. The app is flexible, so you can customize it to fit your needs. It’s built using Flutter.
